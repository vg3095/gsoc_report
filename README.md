# GSOC Work Report

All PR's Link - https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/pulls/vg3095 

Worked on following 3 projects – 
## HDF Data Storage Capabilities
•	Implemented a `HDFWriterMixin` class , which have these functions - 
	  

 1. Method to aggregate selected properties of class
 2. Write these selected properties to a HDF file
 3. A `to_hdf` method that combines both of these methods.

•	It determines, how these properties will be uniformly stored, such as scalars , 1D or 2D objects.          
•	Implemented unit tests for the same using Mock setups.  
•	It can easily be extended and inherited, eliminating the need of implementing HDF functionalities in separate classes.  
•	Wrote Documentation for the same.

## Isotope handling within TARDIS
•	Extended current Tardis Configuration System to support parsing of Isotopic Elements.  
•	Using Pyne library , decayed isotopic elements , and then merge it into normal elemental elements abundance dataframe.    
•	Wrote a console script to convert CMFGEN files into TARDIS format.   
•	Unit tests and Documentation for the same.

## Testing Framework for multiple reference data 
•	Worked on adding ability to test and generate reference data for Plasma module of TARDIS.  
•	It will allow to test Plasma module and easily expand it to add new references.
